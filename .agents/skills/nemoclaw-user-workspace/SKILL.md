# Backup and Restore Workspace Files

Workspace files define your agent's personality, memory, and user context.
They persist across sandbox restarts but are **permanently deleted** when you run `nemoclaw <name> destroy`.

This guide covers snapshot commands, manual backup with CLI commands, and an automated script.

## Step 1: When to Back Up

- **Before running `nemoclaw <name> destroy`**
- Before major NemoClaw version upgrades
- Periodically, if you've invested time customizing your agent

## Step 2: Snapshot Commands

The fastest way to back up and restore sandbox state is with the built-in snapshot commands.
Snapshots capture all workspace state directories defined in the agent manifest and store them in `~/.nemoclaw/rebuild-backups/<name>/`.

```console
$ nemoclaw my-assistant snapshot create
$ nemoclaw my-assistant snapshot list
$ nemoclaw my-assistant snapshot restore
```

`snapshot list` prints a table of version, name, timestamp, and path. Versions (`v1`, `v2`, ..., `vN`) are computed from the timestamp order, so `vN` is always the newest snapshot.

To tag a snapshot with a human-readable label, pass `--name`:

```console
$ nemoclaw my-assistant snapshot create --name before-upgrade
```

To restore a specific snapshot instead of the latest, pass a version, name, or timestamp prefix:

```console
$ nemoclaw my-assistant snapshot restore v3
$ nemoclaw my-assistant snapshot restore before-upgrade
$ nemoclaw my-assistant snapshot restore 2026-04-14T
```

The `nemoclaw <name> rebuild` command uses the same snapshot mechanism automatically.
Snapshot restore performs a targeted repair for legacy `.openclaw-data` symlinks that were created by older images.
Unsafe symlinks and hard links inside sandbox state are rejected during backup creation before they can enter a snapshot.
For full details, see the Commands reference (use the `nemoclaw-user-reference` skill).

## Step 3: Manual Backup

Use `openshell sandbox download` to copy files from the sandbox to your host.

```console
$ SANDBOX=my-assistant
$ BACKUP_DIR=~/.nemoclaw/backups/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
$ mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

$ openshell sandbox download "$SANDBOX" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/SOUL.md "$BACKUP_DIR/"
$ openshell sandbox download "$SANDBOX" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/USER.md "$BACKUP_DIR/"
$ openshell sandbox download "$SANDBOX" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/IDENTITY.md "$BACKUP_DIR/"
$ openshell sandbox download "$SANDBOX" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md "$BACKUP_DIR/"
$ openshell sandbox download "$SANDBOX" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/MEMORY.md "$BACKUP_DIR/"
$ openshell sandbox download "$SANDBOX" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/memory/ "$BACKUP_DIR/memory/"
```

## Step 4: Manual Restore

Use `openshell sandbox upload` to push files back into a sandbox.

```console
$ SANDBOX=my-assistant
$ BACKUP_DIR=~/.nemoclaw/backups/20260320-120000  # pick a timestamp

$ openshell sandbox upload "$SANDBOX" "$BACKUP_DIR/SOUL.md" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/
$ openshell sandbox upload "$SANDBOX" "$BACKUP_DIR/USER.md" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/
$ openshell sandbox upload "$SANDBOX" "$BACKUP_DIR/IDENTITY.md" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/
$ openshell sandbox upload "$SANDBOX" "$BACKUP_DIR/AGENTS.md" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/
$ openshell sandbox upload "$SANDBOX" "$BACKUP_DIR/MEMORY.md" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/
$ openshell sandbox upload "$SANDBOX" "$BACKUP_DIR/memory/" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/memory/
```

## Step 5: Using the Backup Script

The repository includes a convenience script at `scripts/backup-workspace.sh`.

### Backup

```console
$ ./scripts/backup-workspace.sh backup my-assistant
Backing up workspace from sandbox 'my-assistant'...
Backup saved to /home/user/.nemoclaw/backups/20260320-120000/ (6 items)
```

### Restore

Restore from the most recent backup:

```console
$ ./scripts/backup-workspace.sh restore my-assistant
```

Restore from a specific timestamp:

```console
$ ./scripts/backup-workspace.sh restore my-assistant 20260320-120000
```

## Step 6: Verifying a Backup

List backed-up files to confirm completeness:

```console
$ ls -la ~/.nemoclaw/backups/20260320-120000/
AGENTS.md
IDENTITY.md
MEMORY.md
SOUL.md
USER.md
memory/
```

## Step 7: Multi-Agent Deployments

When OpenClaw is configured with multiple named agents, each agent has its own
workspace directory (`workspace-main/`, `workspace-support/`, `workspace-ops/`,
and so on — see Multi-Agent Deployments (use the `nemoclaw-user-workspace` skill)).

`nemoclaw <name> snapshot create` automatically discovers every `workspace-*/`
directory under the sandbox state tree and includes it in the snapshot bundle
alongside the default `workspace/`. `snapshot restore` re-applies the full
per-agent set. No manual per-workspace backup pattern is needed.

The sandbox entrypoint ensures every per-agent workspace lives directly under
the persistent `.openclaw/` tree, so state also survives `openshell sandbox restart`.

### Shared files across agents

Files that operators typically want consistent across every per-agent workspace
(`AGENTS.md`, shared skills, common templates) are **not** synced automatically.
Each workspace is independent; changes in one don't propagate. Operators that
need this either copy the shared files explicitly to each workspace after
editing, or maintain a host-side sync layer. Tracking shared-file tooling
(shared mount, `workspaces list` command) in
[#1260](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/issues/1260).

## References

- **Load [references/workspace-files.md](references/workspace-files.md)** when users ask about `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or other workspace files, or when preparing to back up or restore workspace state. Explains what workspace personality and configuration files are, where they live, and how they persist across sandbox restarts.
