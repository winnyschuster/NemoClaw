# Workspace Files

OpenClaw stores its personality, user context, and behavioral configuration in a set of Markdown files inside the sandbox.
These files live at `/sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/` and are collectively called **workspace files**.

## File Reference

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SOUL.md` | Defines the agent's persona, tone, and communication style. |
| `USER.md` | Stores information about the human the agent assists. |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Short identity card — name, language, emoji, creature type. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Behavioral rules, memory conventions, safety guidelines, and session workflow. |
| `MEMORY.md` | Curated long-term memory distilled from daily notes. |
| `memory/` | Directory of daily note files (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`) for session continuity. |

## Where They Live

All workspace files reside inside the sandbox filesystem:

```text
/sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/
├── AGENTS.md
├── IDENTITY.md
├── MEMORY.md
├── SOUL.md
├── USER.md
└── memory/
    ├── 2026-03-18.md
    └── 2026-03-19.md
```

## Multi-Agent Deployments

A single NemoClaw sandbox can host more than one OpenClaw agent.
When OpenClaw is configured with multiple named agents (e.g., a shared `main` agent
plus per-user agents for a Teams-integrated deployment), each agent gets its own
workspace directory alongside the default `workspace/`:

```text
/sandbox/.openclaw/
├── workspace/           # default agent (single-agent deployments)
├── workspace-main/      # named agent "main"
├── workspace-support/   # named agent "support"
└── workspace-ops/       # named agent "ops"
```

Each per-agent workspace contains the same Markdown file structure as the default
(`SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `memory/`).
Files are per-agent — changes in `workspace-main/AGENTS.md` are not visible to
`workspace-support/`.

Persistence and snapshots are handled automatically for per-agent workspaces:
the sandbox entrypoint provisions each `workspace-<name>/` directly under the
writable `.openclaw/` tree so state survives sandbox restart, and
`nemoclaw <name> snapshot create` discovers every `workspace-<name>/` directory
and includes it in the snapshot bundle alongside the default `workspace/`.

> **Note:** Files that operators typically want consistent across every agent workspace
> (`AGENTS.md`, shared skills, common templates) are not synced automatically.
> Each workspace is independent; changes in one don't propagate. Tracking

## Persistence Behavior

Understanding when these files persist and when they are lost is critical.

### Survives: Sandbox Restart

Sandbox restarts (`openshell sandbox restart`) preserve workspace files.
The sandbox uses a **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)** that outlives individual container restarts.

### Lost: Sandbox Destroy

Running `nemoclaw <name> destroy` **deletes the sandbox and its PVC**.
All workspace files are permanently lost unless you back them up first.

> **Warning:** Always back up your workspace files before running `nemoclaw <name> destroy`.
> See Backup and Restore (use the `nemoclaw-user-workspace` skill) for instructions.

## Editing Workspace Files

The agent reads these files at the start of every session.
You can edit them in two ways:

1. **Let the agent do it** — Ask your agent to update its persona, memory, or user context.
2. **Edit manually** — Use `openshell sandbox shell` to open a terminal inside the sandbox and edit files directly, or use `openshell sandbox upload` to push edited files from your host.

## Next Steps

- Set Up Task-Specific Sub-Agents (use the `nemoclaw-user-configure-inference` skill)
- Backup and Restore workspace files (use the `nemoclaw-user-workspace` skill)
- Commands reference (use the `nemoclaw-user-reference` skill)
