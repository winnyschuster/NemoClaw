# Fix CoreDNS on local OpenShell gateways running under Colima.
#
# Problem: k3s CoreDNS forwards to /etc/resolv.conf which inside the
# CoreDNS pod resolves to 127.0.0.11 (Docker's embedded DNS). That
# address is NOT reachable from k3s pods, causing DNS to fail and
# CoreDNS to CrashLoop.
#
# Fix: forward CoreDNS to the container's default gateway IP, which
# is reachable from pods and routes DNS through Docker to the host.
#
# Run this after `openshell gateway start` on Colima setups.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/fix-coredns.sh [gateway-name]
