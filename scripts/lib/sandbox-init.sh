# ── Capability dropping ──────────────────────────────────────────
# CIS Docker Benchmark 5.3: containers should not run with default caps.
# OpenShell manages the container runtime so we cannot pass --cap-drop=ALL
# to docker run. Instead, drop dangerous capabilities from the bounding set
# at startup using capsh. The bounding set limits what caps any child process
# (gateway, sandbox, agent) can ever acquire.
#
# Dropped (issue #3280): cap_sys_admin, cap_sys_ptrace plus the historical
# set (cap_net_raw, cap_dac_override, cap_sys_chroot, cap_fsetid,
# cap_setfcap, cap_mknod, cap_audit_write, cap_net_bind_service).
# Dashboard listens on a high port (default 18789, validated >=1024 in
# nemoclaw-start.sh), so cap_net_bind_service is unconditionally unused.
#
# Kept (each load-bearing — do not drop without an entrypoint refactor):
#   cap_chown, cap_fowner — needed to chown/chmod files we did not create
#     after dropping cap_dac_override (see #2659).
#   cap_setuid, cap_setgid — required by gosu to step down from root into
#     the sandbox/gateway UIDs during entrypoint privilege separation.
#   cap_kill — sandbox user signals gateway-user processes via the UID
#     separation enforced by the entrypoint (see test 13 in
#     e2e-gateway-isolation.sh).
# When the runtime cannot drop the bounding set (no CAP_SETPCAP, or capsh
# missing), the default is to warn and continue. Set NEMOCLAW_REQUIRE_CAP_DROP=1
# to make that case fail-closed instead — see enforce_cap_drop_if_required.

# ── Privilege step-down (issue #3280 follow-up) ──────────────────
# Replaces direct `gosu <user>` invocations with `setpriv` so the load-
# bearing caps (cap_setuid, cap_setgid, cap_fowner, cap_chown, cap_kill)
# are stripped from the bounding set *atomically with* the setuid
# transition. gosu cannot do this: dropping those caps before gosu
# breaks its setuid() syscall, and after gosu we are non-root and have
# already lost CAP_SETPCAP. setpriv performs reuid + bounding-set drop
# in a single process, in the correct order, before exec.
#
# Two prefix arrays are populated at source time:
#   STEP_DOWN_PREFIX_SANDBOX  — step down to the 'sandbox' user
#   STEP_DOWN_PREFIX_GATEWAY  — step down to the 'gateway' user
#
# Callers use them like the old `gosu <user>` prefix:
#   exec "${STEP_DOWN_PREFIX_SANDBOX[@]}" "${NEMOCLAW_CMD[@]}"
#   "${STEP_DOWN_PREFIX_SANDBOX[@]}" bash -c "..."
#   nohup "${STEP_DOWN_PREFIX_GATEWAY[@]}" gateway run --port "$port" &
#
# Fallback: if setpriv is missing or CAP_SETPCAP isn't available, the
# arrays fall back to plain `gosu <user>` and a warning is logged so the
# residual bounding-set caps surface in the entrypoint log (matches the
# residual-surface design of report_residual_capabilities).
# File-scope array declarations: bash 3.2 (macOS) does not accept `declare -g`,
# but plain assignment at file scope is global by default. Inside
# init_step_down_prefixes() we re-assign these without `local`, which targets
# the globals in both bash 3.2 and 4+.
