# NemoClaw E2E CI

Direct E2E coverage runs through Vitest.

Interactive TUI targets require `expect`. The unified workflow installs it
before those targets run; local runners must provide it themselves.

- `.github/workflows/e2e.yaml` is the scheduled, manually dispatchable, and
  selectively dispatched live target workflow.
- `.github/workflows/pr-e2e-gate.yaml` runs as `E2E / PR Gate Controller` and
  publishes the trusted exact-diff `E2E / PR Gate Coordination` check and the
  native `E2E / PR Gate` job that mirrors coordination into the PR's required
  GitHub Actions check suite.
- `.github/workflows/e2e-branch-validation.yaml` provisions Brev instances and
  runs focused E2E targets from source on a clean machine.
- Platform workflows such as macOS, WSL, sandbox image, and regression E2E
  call their target E2E tests directly. The Ollama auth proxy target is
  selected through `.github/workflows/e2e.yaml`.

The former top-level `test/e2e/test-*.sh` suite has been removed. Keep real
shell, installer, process, Docker, OpenShell, `/proc`, and sandbox boundaries in
E2E tests when those boundaries are the behavior under test.

## Credential-free tests

Credential-free tests that can use the standard Ubuntu runner, CLI build, and
artifact policy opt into the shared E2E job with a tag beside the test:

```typescript
// @module-tag e2e/credential-free
```

Discovery reads tagged files from the `e2e-live` and `integration` Vitest
projects. It derives each test ID from the filename and supplies only the ID,
repository-relative file, and Vitest project to the test matrix. Keep the
filename stem unique and lowercase kebab-case. Do not add the test to a separate
catalog or manually maintained workflow matrix.

The E2E workflow owns the shared job's runner, timeout, setup, permissions,
secrets, and artifact handling. Keep a dedicated workflow job when a test needs
different capabilities, such as credentials, a custom runner, additional setup,
or a different timeout.

Both `jobs` and `targets` selectors continue to accept the test ID. Run the
discovery command locally to inspect the generated test matrix:

```bash
npx tsx tools/e2e/credential-free-tests.mts
```

## Scheduled operations

The consolidated workflow keeps its operational reporting in the same job
graph as the live targets:

- GitHub Actions run history is the authoritative record for scheduled and
  manual E2E results.
- Automated issue routing and the workflow's `issues: write` capability are
  retired. Any future issue escalation should use a separately reviewed
  exceptional threshold, such as the same lane failing twice consecutively or
  remaining broken for 24 hours, rather than posting on every failed schedule.
- `scorecard` writes the scheduled/manual result summary, compares the trusted
  cloud-onboard timing summary with the latest prior-release `e2e.yaml` run,
  and posts to the daily or full-run Slack route.
- Selective dispatches remain silent unless they run on `main` with
  `post_to_slack=true`, which uses the preview Slack route. Branch-dispatched
  runs never receive Slack webhook secrets.

Raw cloud-onboard traces stay under the runner temporary directory. Before
artifact upload, `scripts/e2e/sanitize-trace-timing.py` reduces them to the
allowlisted `cloud-onboard-trace-timing-summary.json` timing schema and deletes
the raw directory. Aggregation ratchets require `report-to-pr` and `scorecard`
to wait for the same execution-job set.

Registry-driven Vitest targets also enable onboard trace collection. Each live
matrix target writes raw traces under the runner temporary directory, sanitizes
them before upload, deletes the raw trace directory, and uploads only
`e2e-artifacts/live/<target>/cloud-onboard-trace-timing-summary.json` with the
target artifact. These per-target summaries are artifact evidence only; the
Slack/GitHub scorecard comparison remains tied to the dedicated `cloud-onboard`
artifact so baseline aggregation stays stable.
Older issue references to Vitest target artifacts under `e2e-artifacts/vitest/`
map to this consolidated `e2e-artifacts/live/` registry-target artifact layout.

## PR E2E gate

The controller, coordination check, and required job deliberately use
different names and report different parts of the lifecycle.
`E2E / PR Gate Controller` reports whether the trusted controller handled its
event. The controller publishes the internal custom check
`E2E / PR Gate Coordination` as its exact-diff verdict.
The default-branch `pull_request_target` path publishes the native GitHub
Actions job named `E2E / PR Gate`. It checks out the controller at
`github.workflow_sha`, validates that the PR still has the observed head and
base, waits for the matching trusted coordination identity, and exits with its
terminal verdict. It also writes that verdict and the trusted run link to the
job log and keeps the job summary free of network-derived content. During
rollout, the observer accepts the former custom-check name
`E2E / PR Gate` for the same exact-diff external identity so in-flight PRs do
not lose their gate.

A handled prerequisite-CI failure, selected E2E failure or timeout, stale
revision, or closed PR can leave the controller green while coordination is
failed or cancelled and the native job is non-passing. Only a successful native
`E2E / PR Gate` for the current head and base satisfies the required check. An
eligible prerequisite-CI failure records the versioned retry reason
`prerequisite-ci`. A selected child records `child-cancelled` only when the
workflow is cancelled or a complete job listing shows that every non-passing
job was cancelled. Assertion failures and other selected-E2E outcomes do not
receive a retry reason. An unexpected controller error still fails the
controller workflow and fails coordination closed, which prevents the native
job from passing.

On open, synchronization, reopen, transition out of draft, or base retarget,
`.github/workflows/pr-e2e-gate.yaml` reserves `E2E / PR Gate Coordination` for
the exact PR head and base commits, including fork heads. The read-only native
observer starts for every configured non-closed PR event; metadata-only edits
mirror the existing exact-diff coordination result instead of publishing a
skipped success. A base retarget fails any still-active earlier coordination
result in that head's lineage, preserves completed audit history, and then
reserves the new exact-diff identity. The
`CI / Pull Request` run name binds its PR number, head SHA, base SHA, and gate
eligibility so the trusted controller can authenticate the completed run even
when a fork `workflow_run` payload omits pull-request metadata. The controller
also requires the completed run's workflow path to be
`.github/workflows/pr.yaml`. Metadata-only edits are marked ineligible and are
ignored by the controller and PR Review Advisor; base edits are eligible. PR CI
and advisor concurrency groups include that eligibility, so an ignored
metadata-edit run cannot cancel an eligible run for the same PR. The trusted
controller reads all changed files after eligible PR CI completes and builds
the deterministic risk plan.
Runtime families and changes to workflow-wired live tests select
canonical selectors from the trusted `e2e.yaml` inventory independently of
advisor output. Ordinary internal changes execute those focused selections.
Gate initialization and CI coordination share one non-cancelling concurrency
group for the head repository and branch. Before the controller creates or
updates coordination for the current revision, it reads the live PR and
requires the event's exact head and base, including when PR CI failed. The
native observer performs the same live exact-revision check before waiting and
again before accepting a terminal verdict. This keeps a stale seed, completed
CI run, or observer from being applied to a newer exact diff. A completed CI
event for an older revision is handled without creating or updating the current
revision's coordination check.
If the older revision still has an in-progress coordination check, the
controller completes it as cancelled with `Superseded by PR update` or
`PR closed — gate no longer applies` and identifies the obsolete head and base.
The closed-PR outcome also applies when a fork repository was deleted and
GitHub consequently returns no head-repository object.
Shared sandbox-boundary changes have a floor of `full-e2e`, `hermes-e2e`, and
`security-posture`. E2E control-plane changes select `cloud-onboard`,
`credential-sanitization`, and `security-posture`. The `e2e-control-plane`
family is a conservative path boundary that includes non-documentation files
under `tools/e2e/` and `test/e2e/`, plus the E2E and PR-CI workflows, risk
policy, dependency and test configuration, and preparation and upload actions.
The Deep Agents Code headless-inference check additionally selects the exact
`ubuntu-repo-cloud-langchain-deepagents-code` typed target. That target is
hashed into the risk plan beside the control-plane floor jobs, so the
controller dispatches both selector types in one correlated workflow run.
An internal revision whose matched control-plane files are drawn only from the
trusted controller and observer boundaries—`.github/workflows/pr-e2e-gate.yaml`,
`tools/e2e/pr-e2e-gate.mts`, and `tools/e2e/pr-e2e-required.mts`—automatically
dispatches those selected jobs.
Any other or mixed internal control-plane revision requires the exact-SHA
maintainer authorization below before credentialed execution begins. If no job
or target is selected, coordination passes without an E2E run and the native
required job mirrors that success.

Before dispatch, the controller verifies that the live PR still matches the CI
run's exact head and base. It uses its own workflow commit when that commit is
still `main`. If `main` advanced, the controller accepts the current commit
only when GitHub reports it as a descendant whose merge base is the workflow
commit, the comparison contains fewer than 300 fully enumerated files, neither
side of a rename enters the `e2e-control-plane` risk family, and a second read
confirms that `main` did not move again. Any divergence, incomplete comparison,
control-plane change, or second advance fails closed. The accepted `main`
commit is recorded as the workflow SHA and passed as `workflow_sha`. Before
matrix or secret-bearing jobs can run, `e2e.yaml` requires
`github.workflow_sha` to match that accepted commit. Each selected job checks
out `checkout_sha`. The same validation verifies that the PR remains open,
belongs to `NVIDIA/NemoClaw`, and still has both the dispatched head and base
commits. The dispatch includes selected jobs, allowlisted typed targets, and
valid plan and correlation metadata. Controller-bound targets are restricted
to the trusted allowlist. Before checking out PR code, the trusted workflow
projects each controller-selected target into a fixed target ID and hosted
runner mapping. The generated live matrix must exactly match those trusted IDs
and runners, and only the trusted projection can configure credential-bearing
typed-target jobs. Ordinary branch dispatch is not an acceptable substitute.
The controller uses GitHub's returned run ID for
waiting, evidence download, and completion, then revalidates that the PR is
still open with the live head, base, and exact-diff coordination identity before
recording a final result. The native observer revalidates the live revision
before mirroring that terminal result.

An internal revision whose control-plane matches include a file outside the
trusted controller and observer boundaries leaves coordination in progress
with `Maintainer authorization required to run E2E`. The native required job
keeps waiting for the authorization flow. No selected job or target runs and no
repository secret is exposed. After reviewing the exact revision, a repository
maintainer or administrator chooses **Run workflow** on `main`, selects
`run-control-plane`, and supplies the PR number, current 40-character head SHA
as `expected_head_sha`, current 40-character base SHA as `expected_base_sha`,
and a specific 10–500-character `review_reason`. The authorization requires the
first workflow attempt and revalidates the actor's `maintain` or `admin`
permission, internal repository origin, open PR, exact head and base, risk
plan, matching pending coordination state, compatible trusted controller
commit, and final live revision. It then updates coordination to
`Running <count> E2E check(s)` and dispatches the selected jobs and targets in
one workflow run. If authorization
fails before a child run is dispatched, the controller restores the
authorization title and leaves coordination in progress so a maintainer can
correct the problem and launch a fresh first-attempt authorization. After a
child is dispatched, a startup failure requests cancellation. Whether or not
cancellation is confirmed, the controller completes coordination as
`Authorized E2E run requires reconciliation`; that exact-diff authorization
cannot be retried because the child may still execute and a retry could start
duplicate credential-bearing work. Inspect the linked run, then update the PR
and run fresh CI before authorizing again.
The native required job treats authorization and running titles as intermediate
waiting states only while coordination remains in progress. It also keeps
polling when the current exact-diff coordination check is a completed failure
with a validated current-version retry marker, so it can follow a later
validated replacement for the same unchanged head and base. That completed
failure remains immutable and cannot be changed by manual authorization. A
later eligible `CI / Pull Request` run can create a fresh coordination check for
the same unchanged open head and base only when the newest failed coordination
check carries a current-version retry reason:
`prerequisite-ci` after the later CI run succeeds, `child-cancelled` after a
conclusively cancelled child, or `evidence-download` after a successful child
whose evidence download failed, was cancelled, or was skipped. The trusted
controller leaves the completed check as audit history, creates and validates a
new `in_progress` check with the same exact-diff external identity, and rebuilds
the deterministic plan before exposing a fresh authorization state. The
controller and native observer select the highest check-run ID only when every
older duplicate is a completed failure with a recognized versioned retry
marker. An unexpected app or mismatched mutation identity, duplicate ID, older
unmarked or otherwise non-retryable terminal state, or multiple active
candidates fails closed. Selected-job product or
assertion failures, evidence policy or integrity failures, schema or identity
mismatches, traversal or provenance failures, reconciliation, controller
errors, unknown states, and failures recorded before retry reasons existed
remain terminal for that exact diff. Fork approval failures are not retried by
PR CI; follow the protected or manual skip path, or update the PR to create a
new head. Update the PR and run fresh CI for the other terminal outcomes. The
normal wait, evidence download, and finish path is the only path that can record
success; the authorization itself cannot make the gate green. A changed head or
base requires a new authorization.

A fork revision that selects jobs or typed targets completes coordination as
failed while the native required job waits for the skip-approval flow. The
controller does not dispatch the selected credential-bearing jobs or targets
or expose repository secrets.
Non-secret PR CI remains required. The failed coordination summary
embeds an explicit link to the same `E2E / PR Gate Controller` run; maintainers
follow that link rather than relying on the coordination check's **Details**
destination. The coordination check publishes only allowlisted skip-approval
metadata for its PR number, mode, head SHA, and base SHA. The native required
job recognizes the approval-required title as an intermediate waiting state.
That controller run starts
`Approve credentialed E2E skip for fork PR`, which waits on the protected
`approve-credentialed-e2e-skip-for-fork-pr` environment. With
`deployment: false`, the job does not create a deployment record. A maintainer
opens the linked run, chooses **Review deployments**, selects that environment,
and approves it. The approval records that the selected credential-bearing
jobs and targets will not run; it does not authorize fork code to run with
repository secrets. The comment is optional, and the workflow reads both the
reviewer and comment from GitHub's run approval history rather than accepting
an actor supplied by the job.

Before rollout, create `approve-credentialed-e2e-skip-for-fork-pr` in the
repository with one or more required reviewers whose approving members have
repository `maintain` or `admin` permission. Do not add environment secrets,
variables, or custom protection apps; this job records the skip approval and
runs no PR-controlled code. Prefer disabling administrator bypass so every
decision appears in the approval history. If **Review deployments** is absent,
the environment may be missing or unprotected, or the run may no longer be
waiting. Configure the environment, update the PR to create a new head, and
trigger fresh upstream PR CI to create a new gate run, or use the manual
fallback described below. GitHub approval
history is not bound to a run attempt, so the controller rejects reruns of an
approval run. Per-PR approval concurrency cancels an older waiting job when a
newer revision reaches the gate.

For the fork button path, the controller requires a first-attempt, in-progress run
of this exact workflow on `main`, at the trusted workflow SHA and with the
`workflow_run` event. It requires exactly one approved review that names only
the exact environment, then verifies that the recorded reviewer still has
repository `maintain` or `admin` permission. The shared resolver revalidates
the open PR, repository origin, exact head and base SHAs, deterministic plan,
matching failed coordination check, and that the controller commit is either
still `main` or
has only a compatible safe descendant as described above. Immediately before
recording success, it reads the live PR again and requires the same exact head
and base. The result records the reviewer, bounded optional comment, validated
approval-run URL, plan hash, and jobs and targets that did not run. The
successful skip coordination check is titled
`Credentialed E2E skipped for fork PR — approved by @<maintainer>` and begins
with `Outcome: APPROVED SKIP — credentialed E2E did not run.` It never claims
that the selected checks passed. The native required job mirrors this
approved-skip success.

The manual fork skip approval on `main` remains available as a fallback. Choose
`approve-fork-e2e-skip` and provide the PR number, current `expected_head_sha`,
current `expected_base_sha`, a 10–500-character `review_reason`, and optionally
an Actions run URL in the exact form
`https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/actions/runs/<run-id>`. Leave
`evidence_url` blank when no supporting run exists. PR, issue, comment, job, and
external URLs are rejected. The controller validates the optional URL's shape
but does not inspect that run's contents. It applies the same PR, role, plan,
failed-check, compatible-`main`, and final stale-revision checks. Any new commit
receives a different gate and requires a new decision; a base change also
invalidates the decision.

The Vitest reporter writes one `risk-signal.json` for each selected job shard
and typed target. Typed targets bind the signal identity to the exact matrix ID
and use the `default` evidence shard. The checked workflow boundary requires
every policy-selected execution path to expose its matching identity, attach
the reporter to every Vitest invocation, and always upload its evidence
artifact.
Each signal binds the observed checkout SHA, expected SHA, plan hash,
correlation ID, and pass, failure, skip, pending, and unhandled-error counts.
The controller retains `pr-e2e-risk-plan-<sha>` for 14 days, while each
signal travels in the selected job or target's existing E2E artifact.
Its private dispatch state is protected by a SHA-256 digest that is verified
before downloaded evidence is classified.

When the plan selects jobs or targets, coordination passes only when the E2E
run succeeds and every expected job shard and target uploads one complete
passing signal with no skips or pending tests. The native required job passes
only after observing that
trusted success. For the current exact diff, every other dispatched outcome
fails. A failed coordination result links the selected E2E run and up to 10
non-passing jobs, including up to three failed step names per job. If GitHub
truncates the job listing or the controller cannot load it, the coordination
check directs the maintainer to the complete run.
The coordinator has a 180-minute job budget and gives the selected E2E run 105
minutes to finish. When that limit expires, finalization cancels the child and
records the non-passing result in the coordination check. The native observer
has a 170-minute job budget and waits up to 165 minutes for a trusted terminal
verdict. Evidence download has its own 10-minute limit. If the selected child
succeeds but the `Download evidence` step fails, is cancelled, or is skipped,
the controller cannot authenticate the child's artifacts. It fails
coordination closed as
`Evidence could not be verified` and leaves `E2E / PR Gate Controller` red so
maintainers inspect that infrastructure failure. This download-only outcome
records `evidence-download`, so a later successful eligible PR CI run can create
a fresh coordination check for the same exact diff. If the download step
succeeds but signals are missing, duplicated, skipped, pending, or report a test
failure, the controller has
completed its work: it publishes the handled red PR verdict and remains green
without a retry reason. Malformed or unsafe evidence, schema or exact-identity
mismatches, and traversal-limit violations remain terminal controller
verification errors, so coordination, the native required job, and the
controller fail closed.
These dispatches suppress PR comments and the scheduled or manual
scorecard, including scorecard Slack reporting.

Synchronizing, reopening, or closing an internal PR cancels its active E2E
runs. A new dispatch also cancels the previous run. The previous controller
then completes the old exact-diff coordination check as cancelled when the PR
revision moved or closed, or as failed when the current revision's selected E2E
did not pass. Native observer concurrency cancels the old required-job run and
starts a new one when a configured non-closed PR event identifies the current
revision. Metadata-only edits restart the observer against the unchanged
exact-diff identity.
The controller does not read PR Review Advisor output, so model availability
and recommendations are not part of merge authority.

## Onboard performance budget

The scheduled/manual scorecard evaluates the trusted `cloud-onboard` timing
summary against `ci/onboard-performance-budget.json`. The budget covers the
warm-system path and is advisory: exceeding the total-duration cap or a
regression threshold emits a GitHub Actions warning and adds details to the run
summary, but does not fail the scorecard job.

The config separates the absolute total-duration budget from total and phase
regression thresholds. Phase regressions are diagnostic and are only compared
when the current run and prior-release baseline contain the same known onboard
phase names. Cold image pulls, first-time model downloads, provider outages,
and runner or network incidents can still affect the signal, so maintainers
should inspect the timing table before acting on a warning.

For PRs, the unified PR Review Advisor builds and renders guidance from the
deterministic risk plan for the PR head commit and changed-file set. It
recommends jobs for known regression families and includes `cloud-onboard` when
changes affect onboard behavior, trace timing, scorecard analysis, budget
configuration, or the unified E2E workflow. Compatibility schema fields may
classify that guidance as required, but rendered advisor guidance remains
non-authoritative. Model advice is additive and cannot downgrade the
deterministic floor. The independent PR E2E controller rebuilds the plan rather
than consuming those recommendations, and the scorecard remains the source of
truth for advisory warm-system trend evaluation.

The `full-e2e` target enforces a separate hard acceptance contract for the
first fresh onboarding path in that job. It measures from the onboard root span
(a conservative anchor before wizard step `[1/8]`) through the first non-empty
agent response, requires the local BuildKit prebuild for the NemoClaw-generated
context without a gateway-builder fallback, limits the total to 205 seconds,
and limits the longest onboard output gap to 60 seconds. A violation fails
`full-e2e`, and the target writes its evidence to `onboard-progress-budget.json`.

These assertions run inside the existing `full-e2e` lifecycle instead of a
second standalone onboarding run. This keeps the measurement on the job's first
sandbox build, avoids warming Docker layers before a duplicate performance
test, and makes `full-e2e` the source of truth for the hard cold-path contract.
